Random plans and ideas for 1.1 and beyond:

* We need set label support for fat16/32. Ideally, we take the code from mtools
  that deals with labels and try to get it out of the package. If
  that's entirely impossible, maybe a kludge like GParted uses should be
  considered *shudder*
 
* To say it bluntly: libparted is a complete dead end. What we have to do is
  separate the backend logic from the core and write backend interfaces so
  partitionmanager can make use of other backends apart from libparted. KDE's
  own Solid would of course be candidate #1 here; unfortunately, it doesn't
  implement much of what HAL does regarding disks, partitions and file systems.
  Also, DeviceKit-disks is around the corner and implementations using it for
  solid begin to materialize.

* People want mount management (i.e. fstab management) in partition manager.
  I've written a small kcm, Mount Manager, as a proof of concept how this could
  look like, but I'm not yet happy with it. Eventually, this will / should /
  can me merged into partition manager.

* The whole lvm/dm debacle. Nothing much useful can be done about it without
  the backend stuff mentioned above, though.

* The interface between core and the file systems needs some more thought.
  Ideally we'd be free to use either external helper apps (like we do now) or
  libraries to achieve the same things. Libraries in this case being libntfs-3g
  and libext2fs. There's one for reiserfs too, iirc. Using libraries we'd
  hopefully be able to get meaningful progress status reporting while resizing,
  checking and so on.
