Random plans and ideas for 1.1 and beyond:

* The whole lvm/dm debacle.

* The interface between core and the file systems needs some more thought.
  Ideally we'd be free to use either external helper apps (like we do now) or
  libraries to achieve the same things. Libraries in this case being libntfs-3g
  and libext2fs. There's one for reiserfs too, iirc. Using libraries we'd
  hopefully be able to get meaningful progress status reporting while resizing,
  checking and so on.

* Information about file system on a separate tab in the properties, unique
  to the file system in use.

* Check if no of sectors fits in an unsigned 32 bit int for msdos partition tables.

* The KPart works but has problems: The context menus don't show up, the status
  bar is missing, maybe more.


Bugs:

* When creating a new partition table the info pane isn't updated with the new
  type.

* Setting flags for partitions appears to work but no flags are set.

* Creating a msdos partition table with cylinder alignment off still creates it
  will cylinder alignment

* Resizing fat32 file systems (a libparted handled one) crashes related to the
  ped timer stuff and Job::emitProgress somewhere.
