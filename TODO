Random plans and ideas for 1.1 and beyond:

* The whole lvm/dm debacle.

* The interface between core and the file systems needs some more thought.
  Ideally we'd be free to use either external helper apps (like we do now) or
  libraries to achieve the same things. Libraries in this case being libntfs-3g
  and libext2fs. There's one for reiserfs too, iirc. Using libraries we'd
  hopefully be able to get meaningful progress status reporting while resizing,
  checking and so on.

* Information about file system on a separate tab in the properties, unique
  to the file system in use.

* Check if no of sectors fits in an unsigned 32 bit int for msdos partition tables.

* The KPart works but has problems: The context menus don't show up, the status
  bar is missing, maybe more.


Bugs:
* creating a partition table on a device that doesn't have one crashes
  somewhere in the createpartitiontable op
