1.0.0-ALPHA2
============

* Add and install a .desktop file.

* Don't allow the user to close the main window while operations are being
  applied.

* Handle activating and deactivating swap. Also, swap does have labels.

* Don't try to print a mount point in the partition properties dialog if there
  is none.

* Show partition table type name and used/max primary partitions in the info
  pane.

* All disk label types but msdos are read only for now, until the support
  situation for them improves.

* Set default value for maximum number of primaries from 255 to 4.

* Actually set the correct disk label type before applying the operation to
  create a new disk label.

* Don't update the partition table widget while operations are being applied.
  This fixes a race condition that would potentially crash the application when
  applying operations.

* Update devices in the GUI after creating a new disk label or undoing
  operations.

* Set the operation state of all operations to StateNone when temporarily
  undoing them right before starting the thread to apply them. This fixes a
  crash when an operation fails and the remaining ones are undone twice.

* Update bug report address and homepage in the aboutdata.

* Unblock SIGCHLD in main so Kubuntu's kdesudo can run the application as root.

* If udevadm settle fails, try to call udevsettle to better support older
  systems.

* Fix the minimum size calculations for partition widgets.

* Add some doxygen documentation.
