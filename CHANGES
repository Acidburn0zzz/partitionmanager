1.0.0-BETA2
===========

* Add an application icon contributed by David Miller.

* Allow setting the file system label in the dialog when creating a new partition.

* Add a context menu to operation list.

* Use a shell script to run partition manager as a child of hal-lock. This
  should in theory (and according to the hal-lock manpage) avoid notifications
  for new devices, but doesn't seem to work that well.

* Fix a bug that would keep the user from deleting a newly created logical
  partition because the application thought there were higher-numbered
  partitions still mounted.

* Add a kcm for KDE Partition Manager. If this is built and installed or not
  can be (like it already is the case with the KPart) configured via cmake.

* Require KDE 4.2. (It will still work with KDE 4.1 but you'll have to hack the
  build yourself to make it work).


1.0.0-BETA1
===========

* Fix a potential crash when merging a New Operation and a Create File System
  Operation.

* Set extended partitions as busy as long as logical partitions inside them
  are mounted.

* Don't silently succeed  when unmounting a partition that cannot in fact be
  unmounted because it has no mount points.

* Prevent creating a new partition table on a device with mounted partitions.

* Add tooltips to partition widgets.

* Don't show cd/dvd readers or writers as devices even if libparted reports
  them.

* Add support for ext4.

* Fix calculation of reserved/free blocks for ext2/3/4.

* Output reason why a mount or unmount might have failed.

* Fix minimum width for extended partitions in the partition table widget.

* Fix a bug where a partition table just created would not disappear when the
  operation to create it was undone.

* Don't allow creating partitions smaller than the device's cylinder size.

* Fix an error that could lead to some space (a few megabytes) between two
  partitions being wasted.


1.0.0-ALPHA2
============

* Add and install a .desktop file.

* Don't allow the user to close the main window while operations are being
  applied.

* Handle activating and deactivating swap. Also, swap does have labels.

* Don't try to print a mount point in the partition properties dialog if there
  is none.

* Show partition table type name and used/max primary partitions in the info
  pane.

* All disk label types but msdos are read only for now, until the support
  situation for them improves.

* Set default value for maximum number of primaries from 255 to 4.

* Actually set the correct disk label type before applying the operation to
  create a new disk label.

* Don't update the partition table widget while operations are being applied.
  This fixes a race condition that would potentially crash the application when
  applying operations.

* Update devices in the GUI after creating a new disk label or undoing
  operations.

* Set the operation state of all operations to StateNone when temporarily
  undoing them right before starting the thread to apply them. This fixes a
  crash when an operation fails and the remaining ones are undone twice.

* Update bug report address and homepage in the aboutdata.

* Unblock SIGCHLD in main so Kubuntu's kdesudo can run the application as root.

* If udevadm settle fails, try to call udevsettle to better support older
  systems.

* Fix the minimum size calculations for partition widgets.

* Add some doxygen documentation.
