KDE Partition Manager
=====================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING

KDE Partition Manager is currently in an early alpha development stage. The
software is functional and has undergone some testing, but it does have known
bugs and there is always a chance you might lose your data.

BACK UP YOUR DATA BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This software allows you to manage your disks, partitions and file systems:
Create, resize, delete, copy, backup and restore partitions with a large number
of supported file systems (ext2/3, reiserfs, NTFS, FAT32 and more).

It is a KDE4 application, so you will need KDE4 libraries to run it on your
computer. It also makes use of external programs to get its job done, so you
might have to install additional software (preferably packages from your
distribution) to make use of all features and get full support for all file
systems.

For quick install instructions see INSTALL.

For a list of currently known bugs see BUGS.

For a list of changes since the previous release see CHANGES.
